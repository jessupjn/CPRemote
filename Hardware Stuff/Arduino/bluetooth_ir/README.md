Arduino 
======
This is the Arduino Uno code for CPRemote Application

The code also uses CY's IRLib (github.com/cyborg5/IRLib/). The library can also be found in HardwareStuff/Arduino/IRLib/

Use the Arduino IDE to first install IRLib and then upload the arduino code to the hardware. 

For everything to work, you must have the following setup as shown in the image below: 

1. BlueSmirf Bluetooth Modem (TX =5, RX =4) 
2. IR emittor connected to a 220 ohm resistor (Pin 3) 
3. IR receiver (pin 11)
